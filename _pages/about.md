**I'm a resourceful problem solver with a passion for learning and trying new things!** My journey as a software engineer began at age 12 when I created a website dedicated to my favorite Pokémon, Mew. Teaching myself **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** ignited a love of coding, leading to various personal projects, freelance gigs, and volunteer roles in web development.

Over the past decade, I've gained diverse experiences in:

- **software engineering**
- **technical writing and editing**
- **translation and interpretation**
- **international development**
- **agile project management**
- **creative arts**
- **hospitality**

After formalizing my technical skills at [Ada Developers Academy](adadevelopersacademy.org), I've designed, implemented, and documented high-traffic features in monolith decomposition, distributed systems architecture, scalable workflow automation, and API development, working with technologies like:

- **Golang**
- **Ruby on Rails**
- **Javascript / TypeScript / React**
- **REST / gRPC / GraphQL**
- **SQL / PostgreSQL**
- **Docker / Kubernetes**
- **AWS**

**I'm currently seeking both temporary and permanent roles** where I can leverage my diverse skill set, with a particular interest in **art, storytelling, data equity, community agreement, AI governance, and care**. I'd love to connect and discuss potential collaborations, so feel free to reach out!
