My journey as a software engineer began at age 12 when I created a website dedicated to my favorite Pokémon, Mew. Teaching myself **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** ignited a love of coding, leading to various personal projects, freelance gigs, and volunteer roles in web development.

Over the past decade, I've gained diverse experiences in:

- _software engineering_
- _technical writing and editing_
- _translation and interpretation_
- _international development_
- _agile project management_
- _creative arts_
- _hospitality_

After formalizing my technical skills at [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org), I've designed, implemented, and documented high-traffic features in monolith decomposition, distributed systems architecture, scalable workflow automation, and API development, working with technologies like:

- _Golang_
- _Ruby on Rails_
- _Javascript / TypeScript / React_
- _REST / gRPC / GraphQL_
- _SQL / PostgreSQL_
- _Docker / Kubernetes_
- _AWS_

I'm currently seeking both temporary and permanent roles where I can leverage my diverse skill set, with a particular interest in **art, storytelling, data equity, community agreement, AI governance, and care**. I'd love to connect and discuss potential collaborations, so feel free to reach out!
