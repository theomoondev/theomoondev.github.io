My journey as a software engineer began at age 12 when I created a website dedicated to my favorite Pok√©mon, Mew! Teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ignited a love of coding, leading to various personal projects, freelance work, and volunteer roles in web development.

Over the past two decades, my career has been enriched by experiences in:

- _Full-stack software development_
- _Technical writing and editing_
- _Agile project management_
- _Translation and interpretation_
- _International relations_
- _Academic research and analysis_
- _Creative expression and performance_
- _Hospitality_

After formalizing my technical skills at [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org), I have designed, implemented, tested, and documented high-traffic features in monolith decomposition, distributed systems architecture, scalable workflow automation, and API development, working with technologies like:

- _Golang_
- _Ruby on Rails_
- _Javascript / TypeScript / React_
- _REST / gRPC / GraphQL_
- _SQL / PostgreSQL_
- _Docker / Kubernetes_
- _AWS_

I thrive in projects that blend diverse disciplines to solve real-world problems, particularly those at the intersection of **art, storytelling, technology, data equity, AI governance, and economic justice**.
