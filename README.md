A simple portfolio website powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme. Hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license). Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
